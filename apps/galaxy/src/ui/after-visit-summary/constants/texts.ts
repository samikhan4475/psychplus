export const additionalInformationDefaultText = `Disclaimer:

This after-visit summary is intended to support the care plan discussed during your visit. It outlines key recommendations but may not include every detail from your appointment. Please follow the instructions provided and contact the clinic with any questions or concerns about your treatment. This summary is a general overview and does not replace professional medical advice or consultation.

Medications & Treatment Plan:
Do not start, stop, or adjust any medications without first consulting your healthcare provider. Any changes to your medication regimen should be made under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional. Treatment recommendations may vary based on individual circumstances and are subject to change over time. Never give your prescribed medications to anyone else, even if they have the same signs and symptoms, as this may cause harm or death. Selling or giving away prescribed medication is against the law. Keep all prescribed medications in secure place and out of reach of children.

Benzodiazepine Use Disclosure:
Do not self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including alcohol and opioids) while prescribed a benzodiazepine as this may cause respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Do not operate heavy machinery while taking benzodiazepines. Common side effects of benzodiazepine use include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, constipation, trouble falling asleep and trouble concentrating. Other adverse effects such as difficulties with memory (increased risk of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease), accidents (such as falling from dizziness or fatigue), tolerance, addiction, and overdose may occur.

Stimulant Use Disclosure:
Stimulants may be used for the treatment of ADHD. These are Schedule II controlled substances due to risk of potential addiction. Side effects such as decreased appetite, weight loss, difficulty sleeping and cardiac effects may occur.

Buprenorphine-Containing Product Disclosure:
Accidental or deliberate ingestion by a child may cause respiratory depression that can result in death. If a child is exposed to one of these products, seek medical attention immediately.  Do not self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including alcohol) while taking buprenorphine-containing products as this may cause respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Only use prescribed benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants as directed by your prescriber. If you are prescribed buprenorphine-containing products, ask your provider about access to naloxone in the event overdose or respiratory depression occurs. Inform your close friends or family about the signs of opioid overdose and respiratory depression and advise them to call 911 if this occurs.
Controlled Medications:
Controlled medications, also known as controlled substances, are drugs that are regulated by the government due to their potential for abuse or addiction. These medications include but are not limited to benzodiazepines, stimulants, opioids and certain sleep medications. If you are prescribed a controlled medication, keep your medication in a secure place and use caution in who you tell about it as theft may occur. If this medication is lost or stolen, you should file a police report immediately. Providers will only supply 30 days of these medications at one time. You may be required to see your provider monthly to have these medications refilled. Your provider will monitor for signs of diversion or misuse of these medications. 

Test Results & Follow-Up Care:
If you are awaiting test results, follow up with the clinic if you have not been contacted within the expected timeframe. It is your responsibility to ensure any recommended tests or referrals are completed in a timely manner. Failure to follow through may affect your care and treatment outcomes.

Changes in Condition:
If your condition changes, worsens, or if new symptoms arise, seek medical advice promptly. Delays in treatment or failure to report changes may affect the effectiveness of your care plan.

Communication & Compliance:
You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information about your health history, medications, and symptoms.
